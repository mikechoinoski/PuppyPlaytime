### Problem Statement

Dogs can get in trouble if they don't have positive things to keep them busy and tire them out. My puppy gets to be around other dogs from time to time but it would be nice if he could be more often. Challenges to him playing with other dogs is that sometimes dogs aren't his size and their energy level might be different. My site will allow dog owners to find other dogs that are similar sizes and ages. It will also allow for owners to select a meet up location that is public or private. Dogs can be rated for how well they get along with other dogs.
